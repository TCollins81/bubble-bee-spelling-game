Bubble Bee Spelling Game

Learning new words has always been a fun and interesting way to describe the world and all the wonderful things in it,  allowing a smoother transition into written and verbal communication techniques. What better way to strengthen ones foundation of vocabulary than through a game? The premise of the game is to focus on teacher input. My game will allow for teachers to enter the grade level, followed by the top ten (or more) words that kids in that particular grade level struggle with. Once this is done, the teacher will be given a login id (i.e last name of teacher and grade level (Lopez1stGrade)) in which she can provide that login id to students of that grade level to practice the game. The function of the game will be to have floating bubbles that contain a randomized letter, and before the start of the game, the student will be shown a word. It is up to the student to correctly "pop" the floating bubble with the correct letter. Once the word is correctly spelled they would be given celebratory praise (i.e by showing fire works, ballons or any other celebratory element) and move on the the next word.
